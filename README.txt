Create the visual structure for a project

Utilizing the zipped psd file in this repository create the Schedule an Appointment page as described in the psd file.


The deliverable

* Please fork this complete repo and create a folder named 'solution' in the same folder where you find this READEME.txt file. 
* Please email us a link to your forked repository.
* Please make the page so that the area titled 'Select an Appointment Time' and the 'Schedule Appointment' button are hidden on initial load. 
* Use jQuery (jQuery UI too) library to show this area when the 'Search for Available Appointments' button is clicked. Extra points to have this section fade in when being shown.
* On all other buttons, when the button is clicked create a floating message using the FancyBox (see http://fancybox.net/) plugin which says 'To Be Implemented'.
* Provide both a standard html and a haml version of the markup.
* Make sure any form or forms and their content are logically organized to best of your ability in terms of what would be posted to the server.
* Your 'solution' folder must contain this structure:

  index.html
  index.haml.html
  css
    schedule_appointment.css 
  javscripts
    (include required libraries here)
  images
    (all image collateral)

* The page should be tested to operate in the following web browsers:
  
  Firefox
  Chrome
  Safari
  Internet Explorer 7+

Commit as often as you can and push your solution when its finished. At least push once when you start the solution and once you end it, we would like to see the time it took to reach your solution also.
