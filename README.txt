Utilizing the zipped psd file in this repository create the Schedule an Appointment page as described in the psd file.


The deliverable

Please fork this complete repo and create a folder named 'solution' in the same folder where you find this READEME.txt file. Please email us a link to your forked repository.

The folder must contain this structure

  index.html
  index.haml.html
  schedule_appointment.css 

Note that you will be providing both a standard html and a haml version of the markup.

The page should be tested to operate in the following web browsers:
  
  Firefox
  Chrome
  Safari
  Internet Explorer 7+

Commit as often as you can and push your solution when its finished. At least push once when you start the solution and once you end it, we would like to see the time it took to reach your solution also.
